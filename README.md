We present STDC-Seg, an mannully designed semantic segmentation network with not only state-of-the-art performance but also faster speed than current methods.
Highlights:

Short-Term Dense Concatenation Net: A task-specific network for dense prediction task.
Detail Guidance: encode spatial information without harming inference speed.
SOTA: STDC-Seg achieves extremely fast speed (over 45% faster than the closest automatically designed competitor on CityScapes) and maintains competitive accuracy.
see our Cityscapes test set submission STDC1-Seg50 STDC1-Seg75 STDC2-Seg50 STDC2-Seg75.
Here is our speed-accuracy comparison on Cityscapes test&val set.
